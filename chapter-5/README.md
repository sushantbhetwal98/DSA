Hash Table
Hash value is a data structure that is used to store the key-value pair. In java script it is simply the object. this is solved by using hash function

Hash Function
Hash Function acts like a translator, taking an input of any size (key) and converting it into a fixed sized value (hash code) that can be used as an index within the hash table's internal array. this process of mapping the arbitrary keys to fixed length indices is called hashing.

    input -> you feed any kind of data into the hash function, like your name, a sentence or a whole file.

    hashing process -> the function performs a series of mathematical operations on the input data, essentially scrambling it up in a unique way.

    Fixed Sized Output -> regardless of the input size, the hash function always splits out a fixed-sized value, like a short string characters or a number.
