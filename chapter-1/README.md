_1.1 DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHM (DSA)_

1. Data Structure -> a specific way of organizing, storing and accessing data.
2. Algorithm -> step-by-step solution of a problem.

_1.2 Big O notation_
Big O notation helps us understand how long an algorithm will take to run (time complexity) or how much memory it will need as the amount of data it handles grows (space complexity).

a. O(n) -> signifies that the execution time of the algorithm grows linearly in propotion to the size of input data (n).

b. O(1) -> O(1) aka constant time, signifies that the execution time of the algorithm remains constant regardless of the input size.

c. O(n^2) -> aka expensive n Indicates that the algorithm's execution time grows quadratically with the size the input data (represented by n).

d. O(log n) -> O(log n) time complexity refers to an algorithm's runtime that grows logarthmically with the size of teh inputs (represented by n). In the simpler terms, as the input size increases, the time it takse for the algorithm to run increases slowly.
